# Stage 2 - Power BI Project: DAX Measures

This project demonstrates the use of advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures in a Power BI report. It is designed to showcase how calculated columns, measures, and KPIs can be used to analyze business data more effectively.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Stage 2 - DAX Measures
- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **File**: `stage2_dax_measures.pbix`
- **Focus**: Data modeling and DAX expression usage to derive meaningful business insights

## Key Features

- Implementation of **calculated columns and measures**
- Use of **time intelligence functions** (e.g., YTD, QTD, MTD)
- Application of **filter and context manipulation** using functions like `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `ALL`, `REMOVEFILTERS`
- Dynamic **KPIs and visualizations** to track performance
- Slicers and interactivity for better user experience

## DAX Techniques Demonstrated

- Basic Measures (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`)
- Conditional Measures (`IF`, `SWITCH`)
- Time Intelligence (`TOTALYTD`, `DATESINPERIOD`)
- Context Transition using `CALCULATE`
- Row context vs Filter context

## How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Review the data model and relationships
3. Explore the report pages to understand how DAX is applied
4. Click on visuals and slicers to observe dynamic filtering and DAX behavior

## Requirements

- Power BI Desktop (latest version recommended)
- Basic understanding of Power BI and DAX

Feel free to customize the project features, techniques, or contact details to suit your actual project. Want me to extract or list the exact measures used inside your `.pbix` file? I can help with that too.
